I’m Mandeep Bora, a software architect passionate about designing scalable, low latency, and high throughput real-time distributed and innovative systems. I have over 30 years of experience in the tech industry, primarily in high-frequency financial trading and cloud-based applications.
As a firm believer in the power of collaboration and the importance of working on core business values with user-centered design, my approach to architecture integrates the latest in technology with robust design principles and ultimately provides the most reliable, cost-effective solution to the customer. I specialize in real-time data streaming and cloud-native design using different architectural patterns. I enjoy leading teams to deliver high-impact software solutions for complex business issues.
When I’m not architecting the next big thing, I’m exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or simply enjoying mentoring aspiring software developers.
I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to drive innovation, solve complex problems, and help organizations build systems that scale with their needs.
